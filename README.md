Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Report for Call Center Leadership

Executive Summary
This report explores the challenges and systemic barriers faced by Gwen, a
neurodivergent employee at a Canadian call center, to propose a comprehensive
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strategy that aligns with the organization’s
goals of employee satisfaction, superior customer service, and operational
excellence.
Leveraging Gwen’s experiences as a case study, the report demonstrates how
fostering an inclusive and equitable workplace benefits all stakeholders by
addressing gaps in workplace culture, enabling accommodations for neurodiverse
employees, and implementing organization-wide DEI initiatives. Specific actions
include sensory accommodations, mentorship programs, anti-bullying policies, and
transparent communication frameworks.
The proposed strategy is supported by organizational behavior frameworks, case
studies of successful DEI implementation in leading companies, and compliance
with Canadian labor laws. By focusing on inclusion, equity, and diversity, the call
center can improve employee engagement, enhance customer satisfaction, and
strengthen its reputation as an employer of choice.
